# Development

The SeDuCe platform is mostly developed using the Python3 language, thus a development tool of choice is [PyCharm](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/pycharm/).
There is a community edition of Pycharm which is free, however you can get a free licence of PyCharm ultimate if you are a member of IMT Atlantique via the [educational licences](https://www.jetbrains.com/fr-fr/community/education/#students).

## Setup the development environment

First, install PyCharm and clone the [seduceboard](https://github.com/SeduceProject/seduceboard) project.
Ensure that you can connect to the `seduce1` server.

In PyCharm open the seduceboard project as follow:

## Add a new web end point

## Add a new periodic task

# Debug

# Deploy
